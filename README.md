# COVID19-Detector-CNN
This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The model classifies X-ray images into two categories: Normal and COVID-19. The primary goal is to assist in the early and accurate detection of COVID-19, which is crucial for timely treatment and containment of the virus.
